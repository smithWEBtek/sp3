        <strong>REBUILDING, REGULATION, TUNING AND VOICING SKILLS</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
          Tuning as many as 1200 pianos per year, my specialty is concert regulation, tuning and tone voicing. Aural
          tuning is my preference.
          In 2006 I completed renovations on a 3000 sq ft. piano rebuilding &amp; refinishing shop in Bedford, NH
          providing
          complete rebuilding and refinishing services, specializing in Steinway restoration
          In March of 2007 I replaced hammers/shanks/flanges on the concert Steinway D for St. Paul's School in
          Concord,
          NH
          in preparation for an April 12th concert by artist, Christopher Taylor. Mr. Taylor played a challenging
          program,
          including all of the Chopin Etudes. We worked together to voice the piano as evenly as possible, including
          full
          shift voicing and half-shift voicing, for maximum dynamic possibilities.
          As an active rebuilder with PTG, I keep abreast of the latest tools and methods for the myriad tasks
          involved
          in
          rebuilding a piano. I maintain an extensive array of tools, jigs, machines and fixtures devoted to the
          highest
          possible quality rebuilding
