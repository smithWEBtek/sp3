							Tuning as many as 1200 pianos per year between 1981 and 2011, my specialty is concert regulation, aural tuning

							voicing. Aural tuning is my preference.
							In 2006 I completed renovations on a 3000 sq ft. piano rebuilding & refinishing shop in Bedford, NH providing
							complete rebuilding and refinishing services, specializing in Steinway restoration
							In March of 2007 I replaced hammers/shanks/flanges on the concert Steinway D for St. Paul's School in Concord,
							NH
							in preparation for an April 12th concert by artist, Christopher Taylor. Mr. Taylor played a challenging
							program,
							including all of the Chopin Etudes. We worked together to voice the piano as evenly as possible, including full
							shift voicing and half-shift voicing, for maximum dynamic possibilities.
							As an active rebuilder with PTG, I keep abreast of the latest tools and methods for the myriad tasks involved
							in
							rebuilding a piano. I maintain an extensive array of tools, jigs, machines and fixtures devoted to the highest
							possible quality rebuilding
