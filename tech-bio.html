          <h4>REBUILDING, REGULATION, TUNING AND VOICING SKILLS</h4>

          Tuning as many as 1200 pianos per year between 1981 and 2011, my specialty is concert regulation, aural tuning and voicing.  Aural tuning is my preference.
          In 2006 I completed renovations on a 3000 sq ft. piano rebuilding & refinishing shop in Bedford, NH providing complete rebuilding and refinishing services, specializing in Steinway restoration


          In March of 2007 I replaced hammers/shanks/flanges on the concert Steinway D for St. Paul's School in Concord, NH in preparation for an April 12th concert by artist, Christopher Taylor. Mr. Taylor played a challenging program, including all of the Chopin Etudes.  We worked together to voice the piano as evenly as possible, including full shift voicing and half-shift voicing, for maximum dynamic possibilities.


          As an active rebuilder with PTG, I keep abreast of the latest tools and methods for the myriad tasks involved in rebuilding a piano. I maintain an extensive array of tools, jigs, machines and fixtures devoted to the highest possible quality rebuilding
