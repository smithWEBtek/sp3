          <br><h5>Onsite inspection, with verbal report: $50
          <br>Onsite inspection, with fancy written report: $125</h5>
          <br>NOTE: inspection is similar to a 'home inspection', in that you will get a solid grasp of the techncial status of a piano, but you won't get a "Market Appraisal". 
          <br>Actual market value for any instrument is best gotten from a piano dealer or person who is actively selling pianos in your target market. The piano inspection information will provide you with excellent material for evaluating market value. It is a technical evaluation, not an appraisal. 
          <br> With that understood, I still do try to provide a feel fro market value based on my years of experience, and advice on the various upgrade paths you might follow with a given instrument. 
          <br> My goal is that you get a piano that will serve your performance needs, with a budget you can handle, so that I have a life time happy customer for normal regular piano service.</h5>
